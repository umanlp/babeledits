# BabelEdits: Pipeline description 

## Language Selection

- We select the 50 languages from XTREME-R. It's an easy choice since they are many and they have a good degree of typological diversity

## Entity Extraction

- There can be multiple strategies to extract entities from BabelNet:

    1. **Babelnet Traversal**:
        - you can use an iterator over BabelNet to get all the entities in the BabelNet graph. 
        - popularity measure: out-degree of the node or in-degree of the node. The latter requires a complete traversal of the graph.
        - Haven't explored this yet since it can be computationally expensive.
    2. **Wikipedia Querying per language** [**CURRENTLY USED**]
        - Wikipedia Page Selection (``get_pages.py``):
            - We selected a suitable time frame to extract the per-page view count. Currently using year 2022.
            - TODO: check BLOOM cutoff
            - We can use the Wikipedia API to get the page view count for a certain language-specific wiki.
            - We save for each page all its inter-language links together with the page view count.
            - We keep only pages that have an English title and remove duplicates.
            - We sort the results by number of inter-language links **filtered by selected languages** (to ensure higher degree of multi-parallelism) and keep the top-10000.
                - TODO compute Spearman correlation between view count and number of **filtered** inter-language links
                - One can create other versions of the datasets by sampling uniformly or taking tail entities
        - Synset extraction (``get_synsets.py``):
            - for each language:
                - We extract the synsets from Babelnet using the English Wikipedia title and save them to disk.
                - We additionally save a frequency-sorted list of relations across all synsets.
    3. **Wikipedia Querying per language + aggregation** (LATER) 
        - Wikipedia Page Selection (``get_pages.py``):
            - Performed as above
        - Synset extraction:
            - GOAL: try to create multi-parallel edit dataset
            - We create a single query list, which contains all the pages from all languages. 
            - TODO: think of how to merge the rankings
            - We extract the synsets from Babelnet using the English Wikipedia title
            - We keep a certain number of synsets, ensuring that each synsets covers all the langauges we selected in Language Selection step.
            - CON: could be limited, also edits could be not parallel

## Prompt Generation and Relation Selection

1. **Relation Aggregation** (`get_relations.py`): 
    - We aggregate the relations from all languages and sort them by frequency.
2. **Prompt Generation** (`get_relations.py`): 
    - For each relation, we gather an example subject-predicate-object triple from the synsets.
    - We ask GPT-4 to generate a question for each relation.
    - EXAMPLE: EDUCATED_AT, Sushmita Sen, Mithibai College -->	Where was \<subject> educated?
3. **Relation Selection**:
    - We manually select the top-100 relations by frequency, together with subject and object and question

## Edit creation
- for each language l:
    - load the retrieved synsets
    - for each synset s: 
        - extract the edges which are in the selected relations set
        - we only keep an edge if the opposing synset has senses both in English and in the target language
        - for each edge e:
            - we randomly select a target synset from the list of synsets which have the same type of incoming edge as e
            - we extract the sense from that synset to make the edits
            - EXAMPLE: (Messi, PLAYS_FOR, Inter Miami) --> (Messi, PLAYS_FOR, Real Madrid)


## Translation

- Is translation necessary? 
- TODO: remove paranthesis from disambiguation pages, remove ""
- We extract all the subject synsets
 from all the datasets and create a glossary (``get_glossary.py``)
- This is uploaded to Google cloud storage (``upload_glossary.py``)
    - TODO fixes are needed!
- We use the glossary to translate the edits to all the languages (``translate_edits.py``)
