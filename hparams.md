# Hparams

These hyperparameters were found using a wandb sweep gridsearch using the v8/translated/val_100.json dataset. Metric used is token_em_lm_eval.

## FT-L

### Llama
Best-found: method.layers=[21] method.lr=0.0005 method.norm_constraint=0.002
Score: 0.1554
Run name: fallen-sweep-16
Comment: By far the best, layer 31 seems to outperform all other layers. Top 3 results are in the layer range 29-31.
Updated: Layer 31 causes model collapse, switched to layer 21.

### Aya # TODO CHECK
Best-found: method.layers=[21] method.lr=0.0005 method.norm_constraint=0.002
Score: 0.1518
Run name: earthy-sweep-46
Comment: Much worse scorses than Llama. Layer 21 seems to be the best layer for Aya. No pattern for where is the best layer range.

### Gemma2 
Best-found: method.layers=[23] method.lr=0.0001 method.norm_constraint=0.002
Score: 0.1209
Run name: major-sweep-49
Comment: Middle region 19-30 seems to be the best. (gemma has 42 layers)


## FT-M

### Llama
Best-found: method.layers=[15] method.lr=0.0005
Score: 0.4618
Run name: astral-sweep-10
Comment: Best layers seem mid-to-late. Much higher scores than other layers. Again, top layers seem to be the best.
Update: Layer 31 causes model collapse, switched to layer 15.

### Aya # TODO CHECK
Best-found: method.layers=[31] method.lr=0.0005
Score: 0.4018
Run name: cerulean-sweep-26
Comment: Best layers seem mid-to-late. Same combination as Llama, but with lower scores.

### Gemma2 
Best-found: method.layers=[27] method.lr=0.0005
Score: 0.4463
Run name: lyric-sweep-22
Comment: Middle region 23-30 seems to be the best. (gemma has 42 layers)


## R-ROME

### Llama

Best-found: method.kl_factor=0.0625 method.layers=[15]
Score: 0.3727
Run name: pleasant-sweep-5
Comment: Low-to-mid layers are the best. Layer 15 seems to be the best layer.

### Aya

Best-found: method.kl_factor=0.0625 method.layers=[7]
Score: 0.267
Run name: classic-sweep-4
Comment: Early layers are the best, around 5-7.

### Gemma2 
Best-found: method.kl_factor=0.9 method.layers=[25]
Score: 0.2236
Run name: stellar-sweep-23
Comment: Rather weak scores, but the best layers seem to be in the middle region 20-27. (gemma has 42 layers)
